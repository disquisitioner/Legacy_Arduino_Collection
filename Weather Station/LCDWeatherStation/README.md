LCD Weather Station
===============

This is my earliest attempt at a basic weather station based on popular sensors for temperature and barometric pressure, and using a simple 16x2 LCD display.
It averages sensor readings over a configurable period and reports those averages via the serial port so they can be further processed by a more sophisticated
device (PC or Raspberry Pi).
